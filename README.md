# GitHub Pages Skills Demo 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub Pages site repository! This project was created as part of the [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) learning modules, specifically to demonstrate how to build and deploy a site using GitHub Pages.

## 📌 Project Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Practice using GitHub Pages to host a static website.
- Demonstrate what I’ve learned in the GitHub Skills module on publishing with GitHub Pages.
- Serve as a foundation for future site customization and potential portfolio expansion.

## 🌐 Live Site

You can view the live website here:  
🔗 [https://mrspecks.github.io/skills-github-pages/](https://mrspecks.github.io/skills-github-pages/)

## 🚀 Deployment via GitHub Pages

This site is automatically deployed using GitHub Pages. Here's how the deployment works:

1. The repository is public and contains a valid HTML file (`index.html`).
2. GitHub Pages is enabled under the **Pages** section of the repo settings.
3. The site is configured to deploy from the **main branch** (or from `/docs` if set).
4. Every push to the `main` branch will automatically update the site.

To enable GitHub Pages yourself:
- Go to the repository **Settings** → **Pages**
- Choose **Branch: `main`** and optionally set the folder (usually `/root` or `/docs`)
- GitHub will build and deploy the site for you automatically.

## 🛠️ Next Steps

This project is a starting point. I plan to:
- Add more custom styling and interactivity
- Use this site as a base for showcasing my portfolio or GitHub activity
- Possibly connect it to a custom domain

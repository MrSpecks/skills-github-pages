# 👋 Hey there, I’m Kagiso!

Welcome to my **GitHub Pages** site – a living, growing space where I share the skills I’m learning, the projects I’m building, and the experiences that shape my journey in tech.

I'm passionate about **creating**, **collaborating**, and **continuously learning**. Whether it's building apps and platforms, experimenting with new tools, or documenting what I’ve learned, this space is where it all comes to life!

## 🧠 What This Site Is About

This page is part of my GitHub Skills learning track, but it's **just the beginning**. Here's what you can expect:

- 📚 Insights from my learning journey  
- 🔧 Projects and side quests I’m working on  
- 💡 Resources that have helped me level up  

I'm here to **inspire others**, share my path into tech, and contribute meaningfully to the dev community through what I build and learn.

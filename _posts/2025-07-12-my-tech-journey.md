# My Tech Journey: Taking the Scenic Route into Tech ðŸš€

Hey everyone, I'm Kagiso Mfusi, and my journey into tech hasnâ€™t been linear, perfect, or traditional. Itâ€™s been real, relentless, and deeply fulfilling. Itâ€™s the scenic route and I wouldn't trade it for anything.

## A Dream Interrupted, Not Destroyed

My story began with ambition. I enrolled in a **Bachelor of Science in IT**, determined to build a future in tech. But after my first year, **financial constraints forced me to step away** from university. It was one of the hardest decisions I had to make, but Iâ€™ve come to realize it wasnâ€™t the end, it was just the start of a different kind of journey.

Instead of giving up, I pivoted. I took on a retail job to stay afloat, and it was during that time that I promised myself: **I would still make it in tech no matter how long it took or what route I had to take.**

## The Learnership That Lit the Fire

From retail, I was fortunate to be accepted into a **systems development learnership at FNB**. This was the spark that ignited everything. For the first time, I got to work inside an actual IT department, not just learning theory but applying it daily. I immersed myself in **agile practices, Scrum ceremonies, GitHub versioning, and JIRA-based workflows**. I built a solid foundation in **Java and object-oriented programming**, and began to truly understand the lifecycle of building software from the ground up.

I was privileged to learn from inspiring professionals whose mentorship planted seeds that still guide me today. Although the program didnâ€™t end with a job offer, it gave me something even more important, belief. The belief that **I belonged in tech**.

## Lessons Beyond Code

After the learnership ended, I took on a customer service role at FNB. What might have looked like a detour was actually a masterclass in empathy, communication, and understanding people, skills that I now realize are just as essential as technical ones.

That role taught me to **think like a user, solve with compassion, and serve with intention**, all of which I now bring into the systems and products I build.

## From the Call Center to the Command Line

The passion never left. I continued to study on my own, dive into open-source communities, and enrol in further training. Iâ€™ve since upskilled across **cloud architecture, cybersecurity, secure development practices, user experience design, and now agentic AI workflows**, all while staying curious and committed to growth.

Over the years, through a mix of formal training, hands-on work experience, and independent freelancing, Iâ€™ve continued to sharpen my skills across a wide range of disciplines. This includes:

- Microsoft Azure fundamentals and DevOps practices
- UI/UX design principles and modern front-end frameworks
- System architecture and full-stack development using tools like React, Vite, JavaScript, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS

Every project, course, and challenge has pushed me to level up not just technically, but also in how I think, collaborate, and approach problem-solving in real-world environments. But more importantly, these experiences taught me how to **learn fast, adapt smart, and never stop building.**

## Why Iâ€™m Sharing This

This blog is more than just a GitHub Skills exercise for me. Itâ€™s a chance to share a glimpse into the path Iâ€™ve walked, the challenges Iâ€™ve overcome, and the purpose that fuels me going forward.

If youâ€™re reading this and your journey hasnâ€™t followed the straight line either.. I hope you know that **itâ€™s still valid, itâ€™s still powerful, and itâ€™s still yours.**

There are many ways to get into tech. This was mine.  
And Iâ€™m just getting started.
